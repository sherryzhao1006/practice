说话很轻很轻的印度小哥~考验听力和耐心的时候啊~
先来max points on a line~秒杀
然后来了个linked list找intersection~本来窃以为不要太简单~没想到他居然无数个follow-up~汗~~
分情况讨论：

    两个没有环，不想交
    两个没有环，相交
    两个有环，不想交
    两个有环，相交
在第三种情况纠结了很久，然后决定上slow, fast pointer找到两个环的起点，然后固定一个起点，另外一个环走一圈看有没有重复
之后又扯淡了很久~

//Better Solution
/*
Two pointer solution (O(n+m) running time, O(1) memory):

    Maintain two pointers pA and pB initialized at the head of A and B, respectively. Then let them both traverse through the lists, one node at a time.
    When pA reaches the end of a list, then redirect it to the head of B (yes, B, that's right.); similarly when pB reaches the end of a list, redirect it the head of A.
    If at any point pA meets pB, then pA/pB is the intersection node.
    To see why the above trick would work, consider the following two lists: A = {1,3,5,7,9,11} and B = {2,4,9,11}, which are intersected at node '9'. Since B.length (=4) < A.length (=6), pB would reach the end of the merged list first, because pB traverses exactly 2 nodes less than pA does. By redirecting pB to head A, and pA to head B, we now ask pB to travel exactly 2 more nodes than pA would. So in the second iteration, they are guaranteed to reach the intersection node at the same time.
    If two lists have intersection, then their last nodes must be the same one. So when pA/pB reaches the end of a list, record the last element of A/B respectively. If the two last elements are not the same one, then the two lists have no intersections.
